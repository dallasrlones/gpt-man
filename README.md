Chrome Extension to Automate ChatGPT to write full Documents such as a Business Plan based on Context you give it via file uploads

## WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently can only upload .txt files

When it errors out it usually does it in 3's lol (probalby a loop code smell on my end) it will try to fix it so sit still.

If it stops typing for more than a few minutes then it's probably broken broken lol.

No typing sounds = bad or process complete

# Installation

Ask chat-gpt how to install a custom chrome extension, you want to "Load Unpacked" the entire folder that was downloaded.

# The Good Shit

If it installed correctly you will see a panel on the right side, click inside the page in the first 1-2 seconds to get sounds.

If you don't have sounds you didn't click fast enough :p

# Getting Started

To begin, upload some files containing the context of yo sheeeeeit

## Context

That fills the context section in the panel, this is like your short term memory AKA context. Once that is generated you can enter a document name and click create doc.

The sound will walk you through the process, I made her custom...you're welcome :p
